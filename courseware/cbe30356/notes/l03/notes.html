<h2>Problem of the Day</h2>
<ul>Energy sources for space missions have always been a problem: solar panels are great, but if the sun is very distant or you are in shade they won't do much good!  One solution has been the RTG, a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.  In this system a radioactive fuel (often Plutonium 238) radioactively decays via alpha emission, releasing heat and not much else (that penetrates, anyway).  This heat source is coupled with a heat sink and the resulting temperature gradient is directly converted to electricity via the Seebeck effect.  It's not very efficient, but it is very reliable - pretty important when you are in deep space!  In this problem we will examine the design of the SNAP-27 reactors which were used to power instruments on all the manned lunar missions.  A description of the device may be found <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4758004">here</a>.  The "back of the envelope" analysis of heat transfer in the unit is given <a href="pod03.pdf">here</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Today we'll be demonstrating the ever-popular can crushing technique.  It's a nice example of just how fast heat transfer occurs in a condensing film, as well as the effect of fluid inertia.

<!--This works fine with the smaller soda cans.  You get complete crushing with an ordinary opening, intermediate crushing if you tear off the bit on the inside and the tab, and minimal crushing if you cut a big hole in the top of the can.  No crushing occurs if you don't invert it, of course.-->
