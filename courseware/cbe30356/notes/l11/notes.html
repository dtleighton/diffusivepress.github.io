<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In this problem we examine the scaling of transport equations: how to eliminate terms which are identically zero and scale out terms which are just "small" in the region of interest.  As an example we shall look at a simple problem from fluid mechanics: the squishing of a volume of viscous fluid between two plates under constant force, predicting how the radius grows with time.  The notes are provided <a href="pod11.pdf">here</a> and the program which plots up the results of the demonstration is <a href="pod11.m">pod11.m</a>.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
We'll see how well the predictions from the problem of the day work!
