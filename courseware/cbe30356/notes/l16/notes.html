<li>Mass and molar Basis conservation laws.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Know how to calculate the diffusion coefficient of a particle in a liquid.
<li>Know how the convection arising from diffusion arises in the transport equations.
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, 17.1-8, 19.1
</ul>

<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we discussed problems associated with homework 7.  In particular, we reviewed the general solution to linear first order ODE's, the Dittus-Boelter correlation for turbulent heat transfer in conduits, and the idea of a hydraulic radius (or diameter) which is used in defining Re and Nu for conduits other than tubes.  Notes for this material are given <a href="pod16.pdf">here</a>.
