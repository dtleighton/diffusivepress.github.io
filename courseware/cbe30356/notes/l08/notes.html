<h2>Problem of the Day</h2>
<ul>In this problem we demonstrate what happens when the Neumann stability criterion is violated in doing our explicit marching solution to the heat equation.  We look at the problem of one-dimensional unsteady heat transfer with a uniform source: easily solved via separation of variables, of course, but comparison with the numerical marching solution is instructive. The notes for this problem are provided <a href="pod08.pdf">here</a> and the marching solution is given in the program <a href="pod08plot.m">pod08plot.m</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>In class today we look at how you can turn an old Christmas light filament into a hot wire anemometer, provided you have a good constant current power source!  The notes describing a "back of the envelope" analysis of the filament are found <a href="lecture08demo.pdf">here</a>.

<!--The bulb was taken from an old string of miniature incadescent lights, the glass was carved away using the grinder, and the "keep the string going if one goes out" wire was pulled away.  At a current of 0.15 amps and blowing strongly on the filament, you get a voltage of about 0.6 V.  This goes up to 0.8 V if the blowing stops.  That suggests that for this current (and in the absence of convection) you get a temperature rise of about 74 degrees (the temperature coefficient of tungsten is 0.0045).  This experiment needs the lightbulb and socket, the fan from the undergrad lab (as well as the anemometer for calibration) and the PIV power supply set to constant current mode (and dialed down!).
