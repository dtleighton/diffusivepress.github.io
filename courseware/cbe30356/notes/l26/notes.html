<ul>
<li>The Maxwell Equations
<li>Debye-Huckel Theory
<li>The Debye Length
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Calculate the Debye length for an aqueous ionic solution
<li>Understand how this length controls the effect of charged surfaces, influencing things from colloidal stability to charged membrane performance.
</ul>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>The lecture closely follows Chapter 4 of the classic text <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Colloidal_Dispersions.html?id=3shp8Kl6YoUC">Colloidal Dispersions</a> by Russel, Saville and Schowalter.  If you are going to do research in this area, it's a good purchase...
