The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Forced convection heat transfer correlations for external flow

<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Know how to calculate the heat transfer coefficient for forced convection.
<li>Know how to calculate the heat transfer coefficient for free convection.
<li>Understand how velocities and temperature gradients scale in free convection flows.
</ul>

<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we will solve the equations for laminar free convection past a vertical plate numerically.  The notes for converting the PDEs to ODEs is given <a href="lecture14pod.pdf">here</a> and the short program for solving the system of equations is <a href="miss8.m">miss8.m</a>.  This is an illustration of how a very difficult non-linear problem can be solved easily if it admits a self-similar solution!

</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we demonstrated the squeeze flow of a concentrated suspension.  There are a number of aspects to this: the difference between flow average and volume average concentration (the difference piles up at the meniscus), the viscous fingering instability which occurs when a more viscous fluid is displaced by a less viscous one (think trapped oil in tertiary oil recovery), and the scaling associated with shear-induced particle migration.  The scaling analysis which allows us to predict the radius at which the effect is observable is given <a href="lecture14demo.pdf">here</a>.
