<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we will look at arguably the most expensive radiation shield ever made: the tennis court sized
 multilayer radiation shield for the Webb space telescope, and examine why it has its rather peculiar looking design.  A description of the sunshield is provided <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/sunshield.html">here</a>. A brief analysis of why it is designed the way it is is provided <a href="pod15.pdf">here</a>.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
While diffusion is a very slow process it can be accelerated by convection induced by density gradients resulting from diffusion.  In this demonstration we look at the visually appealing dissolution of a row of Skittles on a curved plate.  As the Skittles dissolve in the hot water the higher density of the sugar laden water drives a gravitational current to the center of the plate.  Lateral diffusion is so slow, however, that the colored streaks remain segregated, yielding the observed pattern.
