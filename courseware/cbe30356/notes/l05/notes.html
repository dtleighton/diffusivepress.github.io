<h2>Problem of the Day</h2>
<ul>In this problem we investigate how the Sturm-Liouville solution for a sphere at large Biot number can be used to calculate an effective internal heat transfer coefficient.  The notes for this calculation are given <a href="pod05.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Today's demonstration is the Benard-Marangoni instability.  This occurs when there is a thin layer of fluid with a free surface above which is heated from below, and relies on the temperature dependence of surface tension.  Local upwelling leads to a higher surface temperature, local decrease in surface tension, and thus a net convection away from the upwelling region.  The effect is to have self-sustaining circulation cells which are visualized by the organization of tracers distributed on the bottom plate (drawn towards the centers of the upwelling regions).

<!-- Use about 20 ml of mineral oil and add in 400 micron dyed acrylic spheres.  Stir in a small beaker and pour in most of it (about 12 ml) to cover the bottom of the petri dish.  Turn on the heat to about 3 (2 didn't work initially) and wait.  Once it gets hot you get a nice self-organization at the centers of the upwelling regions.  Try adding some parsley flakes to the top to see the surface flow (paprika didn't work too well).-->
