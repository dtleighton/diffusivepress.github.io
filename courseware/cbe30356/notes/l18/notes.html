The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Gas phase mass transfer with reaction
<li>The Thiele Modulus and Effectiveness Factor
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Know the difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions are (and how to treat them in mass transfer problems!).
<li>Know who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Thiele">Ernest Thiele</a> was (a famous ChE who taught at ND for a decade).
<li>Determine how mass transfer affects reaction rates in a catalyst pellet.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, 18.3, 18.7
</ul>

<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In this problem we derive Thiele's Effectiveness Factor for a flat catalyst particle and demonstrate its similarity to the result for a sphere.  Since these are probably the most dissimilar shapes, it shows that the simple expression using a Thiele modulus based on the volume/surface ratio is a pretty good approximation for general shapes (e.g., cylindrical pellets, etc.).  The notes for this are provided <a href="pod18.pdf">here</a>.
