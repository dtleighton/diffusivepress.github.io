<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>Rather than solving another problem, it seems like a good point to pause and review the various solution techniques we've learned so far.  While all these techniques have focused on heat transport in solids, fundamentally transport is transport and so we'll be using the same techniques for convective transport of mass, momentum, and energy!  The notes are provided <a href="pod10.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>In this demonstration we look at the analogous fluid mechanics problem: Oscillation of a plate and the decay of the wave at the surface with depth and frequency of oscillation.
<!--The easiest way to demonstrate the effect is to change the Womersley number by making the layer thicker.  Using the cam system and petri dish connected to the shaft encoded motor, we can get a period of 70RPM (minimum).  We can get a womersley number of 1 if you have a 0.15cm thick layer (9.4ml in 8.9cm ID petri dish) of 0.165 stokes fluid (64.5% volume fraction glycerin).  Doubling to 18.7ml increases to 2 and doubling again gets you a womersley number of 4.  At 1 you have 92.5% of the lower surface amplitude (which is blurry in zoom), at 2 you have 52% (a noticeable slowdown), and at 4 the amplitude is only 12% - the markers are barely moving.  Using binder punchouts works nicely as markers.  Make sure that you -don't- have a nut on the bolt off the rotating shaft, as it tightens with rotation and locks up.  Try a bit of clay or a rubber ring instead.-->
