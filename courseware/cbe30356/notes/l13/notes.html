<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we will discuss the dimensionless groups we've looked at this semester and examine how to analyze a double-pipe heat exchanger.  Brief notes on this are provided <a href=pod13.pdf>here</a>.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we will demonstrate the fascinating problem of a double-diffusive instability.  This occurs in many systems, notably in the ocean when warm salty water overlays cooler fresh water such as would occur in cases where there is melting ice.  As the warm fluid cools down it becomes denser, and goes from being stably stratified (less dense fluid on top) to unstably stratified.  This causes the growth of plumes of water changing places, and is a major mechanism for nutrient transport in the oceans.  An interesting description of the phenomenon is found in the article by Huppert and Turner given <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/media/wits-university/conferences/misgsa/documents/2019/MISG2019StudyGroupProblems_Huppertdoublediffusive_convection.pdf">here</a>.

<!--This one is a little tricky.  In the 600ml beaker combine 300ml glycerin and 100ml water and stir.  Pour 300ml off into the 400ml beaker and reserve, put the 100ml remaining in the larger beaker on the hot plate.  Add in about 5 drops of the blue food coloring, stir a bit, and let it get hot.  Using the 3ml syringe add 3ml of water to the reserved (colorless) portion and stir it up.  Take the heated blue mixture off the hot plate and get the camera set up (it will cool slowly).  Add the colorless fluid through the funnel to the bottom of the beaker as quickly as possible, taking care to avoid getting lots of bubbles inserted into the mixture.  The instability will set up during this process (unfortunately) but you should still see lots of plumes from the lower surface of the dyed layer.  The concentration is 0.7915 (colored phase) with a density difference of 0.002g/cm^3 at room temperature.  The viscosity at room temperature is 0.48p and the coefficient of thermal expansion is 6.0e-4 at room temperature.  If the colored fluid is at a temperature of 50°C (28°C difference) then the density difference at the same concentration is 0.0165 g/cm^3, an order of magnitude greater.-->
