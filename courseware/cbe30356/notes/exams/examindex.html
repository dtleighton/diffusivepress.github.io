<h2>CBE30356 Previous Examinations</h2>
<h3>You will find below links to previous examinations in CBE 30356.  The exams are all in pdf format, and can be printed out for study purposes.  You will
note that some of the exams also have solutions, which are streamed video files where I describe how
to solve the problems.  The best way to use these exams and solutions is to solve them individually, and
then get together with your classmates in groups to discuss (or defend!) your answers.  You can 
compare your answers to my solution approach (the videos are not terribly exciting, I'm afraid), 
and see how it differs from yours (there is often more
than one way to get to the correct answer!).  If you got a problem wrong, you should put the 
video away and re-solve the problem on your own until you are sure that you have it right.  While this
takes time, of course, it should lead to mastery of the covered material...
