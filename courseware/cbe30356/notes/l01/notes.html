<h2>Demonstration:</h2>

The demonstration today is the phenomenon of conductivity: how long does it take energy to propagate down a rod heated at one end.
<!--The new version of this is to use rods coated with thermochromic paint.  The thermochromic powder changes from dark blue to clear when the temperature exceeds 82 degrees.  Three rods have been stuck into a styrofoam block.  The rods are an aluminum nail, a steel bolt, and a wooden dowel.  The diffusivities are about 1 cm^2.s, 0.1 cm^2/s, and 0.001 cm^2/s.  The block is set on a mug with hot water in it, and the wave of color change propagates much faster for the aluminum than for the steel (should be around 10x faster, depending on the unknown alloys).  The dowel would be 1000x slower - but never really changes.  The change is reversed by putting the block on top of a glass of ice water.  A twistem is put at the base of each rod so that it won't "drip down" through the block when heated - keeps it at the desired height.  It is also interesting to look at the colored birds popping out on the "birds on a wire" mug (ceramic diffusivity of around 0.01 cm^2/s, thickness of about 3/16").  The aluminum nail is around 4 inches, so the time to pop out should be around 60 times longer for the mug [L^2/alpha]).

What is needed: the block and painted rods, the old insulated ND mug, a short glass, heater, beaker with ice, empty beaker, bottle of water.  The birds on a wire mug too.


The aluminum rod is drilled to accept the tip of the 40W soldering iron.  The trick to making it behave is to get a nice coating of wax on the aluminum and then attach a bit of dental floss tied to a paperclip to the rod with a pretty big gob of wax (if it is too small the weight of the paperclip isn't enough to drag off the dental floss).  Interestingly, because wax melts at about 33 degrees above ambient the melt zone propagates nearly linearly in time (the boundary condition is a constant heat flux at the base, not a constant temperature).  Six of the paperclips is about right.
