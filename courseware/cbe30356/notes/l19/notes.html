The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Diffusion with reaction in liquids
<li>Hole transfer in Sb2S3 solar cells
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Know what the Hatta number is.
<li>Understand how a first order consumption reaction affects both steady-state and transient diffusion problems.
<li>Figure out how to extract diffusivities and mass transfer coefficients from transient concentration measurements.
</ul>

<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
In this problem we examine the related problem of gas absorption from a sparger: the idea is that you release bubbles of gas with total surface area A into a well-mixed volume V. The gas dissolves into the liquid and reacts away, with the mass transfer limitation being approximated by diffusion through a thin film at the surface of the bubble.  The notes for this problem are provided <a href="pod19.pdf">here</a>.
