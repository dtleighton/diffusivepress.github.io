<h2>Problem of the Day</h2>
<ul>Usually the asymptotic solution at long times to a transient problem is steady - but not always!  In this problem we look at how you solve a problem where the asymptotic solution is still a function of time.  The notes for this problem are provided <a href="pod06.pdf">here</a> and the short matlab program to plot up the series solution is <a href="pod06plot.m">pod06plot.m</a>.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>In this demonstration we look at the natural convection pattern produced by a quenched sphere (OK, a spheroidal jade weight) in a fluid.  By suspending the cooling object at the midplane of a stratified fluid (lower fluid is dyed) the boundary layer around the object and convective plume can be directly observed.

<!--This one is a little tricky to set up.  You need a couple of 600ml beakers, a smaller beaker, about 500ml or so of glycerin, around 300ml of water, dye, funnel (with narrow bore), the taller ring stand with bar, the jade weight with a thread and paperclip for suspending it, and the heater.

Put 200ml of water in one of the 600ml beakers, set it on the heater, turn it up to "5" and put in the jade weight with paperclip hanging off the outside.  It takes quite awhile to get up to a boil.  Prepare the stratified fluid as follows.  Pour 400ml of glycerin into the other 600ml beaker and add 100ml of water, stirring it up vigorously.  Now pour off 150ml into the small beaker and add around 10 drops of green dye to it, stirring it in.  Now add another 20ml of water into the remaining fluid (around 350ml) in the large beaker and stir it up.  Insert the funnel into the beaker so that it touches the bottom and add the dyed liquid, making sure that after the first couple of bubbles come out no more get trapped to mess things up.  Make sure that the bar on the ringstand is set at the correct height so that the interface will be at the midplane of the jade weight when you hang it up (do this first before heating - it should be at the 150ml line of the beaker).  Once the weight is hot, carefully lower it in and hang it on the bar.  The profile is clearest when observed from the ends (with the holes).  Once it winds down you can actually take it out and reheat it a couple of times before the stratification gets too messed up.  When you are all done you can pour all the liquids into the bottle that had the glycerin in it for transport back to the lab.

You will want some paper towels with this one - including using a paper towel as backing for more clearly seeing the profile.

Some additional notes: the volume fraction of the lower fluid would be 80% by volume, and the upper fluid would be 75.7%.  This yields a density difference of 0.01g/cm^3, a kinematic viscosity in the upper region of 0.41 stokes (lower region of 0.63) and a Pr of 429 and 662 respectively.  That means that the momentum boundary layer will be some 20 times the thickness of the energy boundary layer, which is why it is more easily visualized (It's also really laminar).
