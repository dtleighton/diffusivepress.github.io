<h2>Problem of the Day:</h2>
<ul>
The constant wall heat flux problem is useful because it has a simple analytic solution far down the tube (e.g., Nu = 48/11).  In many cases, however, it is more reasonable to look at the solution for the analogous case of a step change in temperature at the wall.  In this case the asymptotic heat transfer coefficient is only obtainable from the Sturm-Liouville soluton (and yields a slightly lower Nu of 3.66).  The code which describes this is given by <a href="nusseltconstantwall.m">nusseltconstantwall.m</a>.  The notes on the problem are found <a href="pod12.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we will demonstrate an enhanced separation process: the Boycott effect.  Originally described by A. E. Boycott in a brief letter to Nature in 1920, he observed that erythrocytes would settle out faster in a test tube if the tube were simply tilted at an angle.  This phenomenon, closely related to the natural convection problem we will study next week, is described in detail in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112079000720">paper</a> by Acrivos & Herbolzheimer.  The phenomenon forms the basis of lamella plate clarifiers for wastewater: basically, you place an array of plates at an angle in a vessel you would like clarified and particles settle out at a greatly accelerated rate.  In recent years it has been of concern in effects as diverse as proppant distribution in fracking and mineral segregation in magma chambers.

<!--The solution which worked well is a mixture of 107ml glycerin and 43ml water.  24g of 200Âµm glass spheres are added.  The experiment is carried out in a 100ml graduated cylinder.  The tilting is provided by taking the bottom off and putting the cylinder in an 800ml beaker.  The beaker is filled with water to minimize the refraction issues and enable students to see the boundary layer clearly.  Particle motion comes out fine in the zoom.-->
