The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Electroosmosis
<li>Capillary Electrophoresis
<li>Streaming Potential
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Calculate the electroosmotic velocity resulting from a charged surface and a tangential electric field.
<li>Understand how electrophoresis can be used to separate species based on their electrophoretic mobility.
<li>Calculate the current resulting from an imposed shear flow tangential to a charged surface.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>The lecture closely follows Chapter 7 of the classic text <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Colloidal_Dispersions.html?id=3shp8Kl6YoUC">Colloidal Dispersions</a> by Russel, Saville and Schowalter. 
<li>The Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis">capillary electrophoresis</a> provides a good introduction to the topic as well as many other references.
<li>The article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential">membrane potential</a> is also very good.
<li>An article from our group on how you can modify the profile of a spiral channel to reduce dispersion is found <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ac010718c">here</a>.
