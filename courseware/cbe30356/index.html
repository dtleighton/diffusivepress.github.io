<h3>Transport Glossary</h3>
<ul>For the Transport I class we've prepared a glossary of terms, primarily focusing on Fluid Mechanics.  Because all of transport is really the same thing, however, it is very useful background for this class as well.  The glossary is given
<a href="../cbe30355/notes/transportglossary.pdf">here</a>.
<!--  To help you learn all the terms, I have prepared a set of quizzes that you can access from the class page in Sakai.  These are not assigned, but are very helpful.  To encourage you to do them (and submit as often as you like), edible prizes will be distributed to the top 6 scorers as of midnight on 1/15/23 (in the event of ties, the award will go to whoever posts the score first).
-->
</ul>
<h3>Transport Math</h3>
<ul>Because math skills tend to get rusty rather quickly, I've put together a page summarizing the key techniques we will be using for both Transport I and II. It is given <a href="../transportmath/">here</a>.

<li>The Transport Glossary
<li>The class notes
<li>R. B. Bird, W. E. Stewart and E. N. Lightfoot, <i>Transport phenomena,</i> New York, Wiley, 2006 edition.

<ul>This is an update (after 40 years!) of -the- classic text on transport phenomena.  Although at a high level, it provides
excellent development and applications of the microscopic equations governing transport.  Many chemical engineers find this to be a useful reference text in
their later careers.  I still fish mine out some four decades after first taking
transport.  The international version is acceptable for this course.

<h3>Daily Quiz</h3>
This course is divided into on-line prerecorded lectures in addition to the regular in-person session.  I ask you to listen to the narration of the notes (generally a whole lot shorter than a 75 minute lecture, as I tend to leave out all the fun stories) and answer a daily quiz associated with that lecture in Canvas.  It is a lot easier if you look at the quiz questions before listening to the lecture, which is fine - but you really do need to listen to the lecture!  You will get two tries at each quiz before the in-person class, and one try after (both the before [better of the pair] and after lecture quizzes count). The cumulative quiz score at the end of the semester will count the same as the mid-term, so don't forget to do them!  

<p>Our scheduled in-person class will be reserved for demonstrations, stories, answering questions, help on homework, etc. - all the fun stuff.  We will also be solving the "problem of the day" in class to give you extra practice in setting up and solving things.
