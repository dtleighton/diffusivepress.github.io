Narrated lecture notes will be provided for each class.  Each of these will be available through the class website.  Students are to view the notes and complete a short quiz for each class on Canvas.  Students get two tries at the quiz before class (the higher score counts) and one try after class.  The cumulative quiz score will count the same as the mid-term. The in-person class session will be reserved for answering questions, running demonstrations, and help with homework assignments.  We will also solve a "problem of the day" selected to illuminate the topic of the day's lecture.</ul><hr>

<h2>Textbooks</h2> 
Reference material consists of the following:
<ul>
<li> The course website at <a href = "https://diffusivepress.org/courseware/cbe30356">https://diffusivepress.org/courseware/cbe30356</a>
<br><br>
<li>The course notes. A complete pdf is available on the class website together with the narrated lecture for each class.  
<br><br>
<li>The glossary of terms.  This is reference material for Transport I, but as the two classes are very closely related, it should prove useful this term as well!
<br><br>
<li>A detailed set of notes and narrations on the key mathematical techniques used in solving transport problems.  A link to this <a href="../transportmath/">Transport Math</a> page is also on the class website.

<li>R. B. Bird, W. E. Stewart and E. N. Lightfoot, <i>Transport phenomena,</i> New York, Wiley, 2006.
This is an update of -the- classic text on transport phenomena.  Although at a high level, it provides
excellent development and applications of the microscopic equations governing transport.  The international version is fine for this class.

<h2>Grading</h2>
There will be weekly homework assignments (15%), one mid-term examination (25%), a cumulative daily quiz (25%) and a final exam (35%).  The weekly homework is designed to teach students how to approach, set up, and solve transport problems.  Students are encouraged to discuss homework approaches and solution techniques with each other and with the instructors, however the final version turned in should represent individual work - no copying!  "Solution files" from previous semesters are NOT to be used.  Homework will be turned in on-line.  Exams are closed books and notes, and are returned individually in class.

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
After completing this class students should be adept at recognizing, formulating, scaling, and solving problems in transport phenomena.
