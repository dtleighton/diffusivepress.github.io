<h3>Index Notation</h3>
<ul>This semester we will make use of index notation alongside standard vector notation.
Detailed notes describing the properties and some uses of index notation are given
<a href="notes/indexnotation.html">here</a>.

</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Transport Glossary</h3>
<ul>In order to help you better understand fluid mechanics, we have prepared a glossary of terms, phenomena, dimensionless numbers, etc., that we will be using this term.  If you memorize this material, you will be far along the path to better understanding fluids!  The glossary is given
<a href="notes/transportglossary.pdf">here</a>.  To help you learn all the terms, I have prepared a set of quizzes that you can access in Canvas.  Note that this canvas site is different from the registrar assigned class canvas site (which will have the daily quizzes), however you should have received an invitation to the glossary quiz site.  If not, send me an email!  The glossary quizzes are not assigned, but are very helpful.  To encourage you to do them (and submit as often as you like), edible prizes will be distributed to the top 6 scorers as of midnight on 8/24/25 (in the event of ties, the award will go to whoever posts the score first).

</ul>
<h3>Transport Math</h3>
<ul>Because math skills tend to get rusty rather quickly, I've put together a page summarizing the key techniques we will be using for both Transport I and II. It is given <a href="../transportmath/">here</a>.
</ul>
<!--<hr>
<h3>Web Based Explorations</h3>
<ul>In addition to class readings, I recommend that you further explore interesting
topics in transport phenomena by using the resources available on the web.  To this
end, each day's lecture will also have a link to a website I found interesting.  An index
of these sites is provided <a href="notes/explorations.html">here</a>.

</ul>
-->
<hr>
<h3>Printable Version of Notes</h3>
<ul><p>A pdf version of the notes is given <a href="notes2025.pdf">here</a>.  I strongly recommend that you print them out and bind them at Kinko's, or use one of the online services.  There's about 400 pages, so if you don't mind reading in a more compressed manner, a four per sheet version can be easily generated from the pdf using the "layout" print option.  They are useful to scribble on, and you will likely find them a useful reference in the future!</p>
</ul>

<h3>References</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Transport Glossary
<li>The class notes
<li>R. B. Bird, W. E. Stewart and E. N. Lightfoot, <i>Transport phenomena,</i> New York, Wiley, 2006 edition.

<ul>This is an update of -the- classic text on transport phenomena.  Although at a high level, it provides
excellent development and applications of the microscopic equations governing transport.  Many chemical engineers find this to be a useful reference text in
their later careers.  I still fish mine out some four decades after first taking
transport.  The international version is acceptable for this course.
Chapters 1-8 are appropriate for this course.</ul>

<h3>Daily Quiz</h3>
Originally done because of the pandemic, the course is divided into on-line prerecorded lectures in addition to the regular in-person session.  While I trust this won't be required this fall, it was actually quite successful and prefered by the students in the class.  Thus, we'll keep it this term as well! I ask you to listen to the narration of the notes (generally a whole lot shorter than a 75 minute lecture, as I tend to leave out all the fun stories) and answer a daily quiz associated with that lecture in Canvas.  It is a lot easier if you look at the quiz questions before listening to the lecture, which is fine.  You will get two tries at each quiz before the in-person class.  You will get a single try at the "copy" due after the class - but both the before and after quizzes count!  I'm happy to talk with you about the quiz during office hours the day before, so it helps to try in early! The cumulative quiz score at the end of the semester will count the same as the mid-term, so don't forget to do them!  

<p>Our scheduled in-person class will be reserved for demonstrations, stories, answering questions, help on homework, etc. - all the fun stuff.  We will also be solving the "problem of the day" in class to give you extra practice in setting up and solving things. 
<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>

a highlighted date to access the homework due that day.  Your scanned solutions should be turned in on-line by 11:55pm on the due date.  We are using Gradescope this term.<p>
