<li><H3>Teaching Approach</H3>
Narrated lecture notes will be provided for each class.  Each of these will be available through the class website.  Students are to view the notes and complete a short quiz for each class on Canvas.  Students get two tries at the quiz before class (the higher score counts).  You will get a single try at the "copy" due after the class - but both the before and after quizzes count!  The cumulative quiz score will count the same as the mid-term. The in-person class session will be reserved for answering questions, running demonstrations, and help with homework assignments.  We will also solve a "problem of the day" selected to illuminate the topic of the day's lecture.</ul><hr>

<h2>Textbooks</h2> 
Reference material consists of the following:
<ul>
<li> The course website at <a href = "https://diffusivepress.org/courseware">https://diffusivepress.org/courseware</a>
<li>The course notes.  It is highly recommended that you print them out so that you can annotate them in class.  You can coil-bind the printed version for a couple of bucks at the Kinkos in the Huddle.  
<br><br>
<li>The glossary of terms.  This is an aid to understanding the "language" of fluid mechanics that we will be using this term.
<br><br>
<li>R. B. Bird, W. E. Stewart and E. N. Lightfoot, <i>Transport phenomena,</i> New York, Wiley, 2006.
This is an update of -the- classic text on transport phenomena.  Although at a high level, it provides
excellent development and applications of the microscopic equations governing transport.  As the problem sets are not drawn from the text, the international version of BS&L is fine for this class.
Chapters 1-8 are appropriate for this course.

<h2>Grading</h2>
There will be weekly homework assignments (15%), one mid-term examination (25%), a cumulative daily quiz (25%) and a final exam (35%).  The weekly homework is designed to teach students how to approach, set up, and solve transport problems.  Students are encouraged to discuss homework approaches and solution techniques with each other and with the instructors, however the final version turned in should represent individual work - no copying!  "Solution files" from previous semesters are NOT to be used.  Homework will be turned in on-line.  Exams are closed books and notes, and are returned individually in class.
