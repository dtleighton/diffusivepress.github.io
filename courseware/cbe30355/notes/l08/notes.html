<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Crooke's Radiometer:
</ul>
<ul>In our class demonstration today we looked at Crookes' Radiometer, which was
initially thought to be a demonstration of the momentum associated with quanta of
light.  It took many years before the noted hydrodynamicist Osborne Reynolds (1879) 
was able to show that it was actually a demonstration of the migration of molecules due 
to thermal gradients around the edges of the vanes.  For a detailed explanation of the 
phenomenon and its history, go <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/LightMill/light-mill.html">here</a>.
