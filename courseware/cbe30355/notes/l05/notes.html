The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Conservation of Mass
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Derive the continuity equation and use it to solve for the average velocity in a pipe system.
</ul>
<hr>
<!--
<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>In class we've been dealing with conservation of mass and the continuity equation.
Perhaps the ultimate in matter conservation problems is the study of cosmology - the 
evolution of the universe we live in.  An interesting guide to the current theory of
cosmic evolution from the Big Bang to the present is given
<a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_01.htm"> here</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>In class today we demonstrated how you can use Archimedes Law to measure the density of an object using a scale, a thread, and a beaker of water.  Although it isn't clear -exactly- what happened way back when, the legend is that Archimedes developed the idea to determine whether a goldsmith was honest in making a crown for the king, or whether he substituted in a base metal for a fraction of the gold (pocketing the rest).  There are many websites discussing this famous example of hydrostatics, a good one can be found <a href="https://math.nyu.edu/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html">here</a>.  This site includes a translation of Galileo's take on what really happened...
