After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Calculate the velocity distribution for inviscid, irrotational flow via solution to Laplace's equation.
<li>Know what boundary layer separation and pressure recovery mean!
</ul>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 4
</ul>

<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>Today we talked about inviscid flow past a cylinder, and by analogy invicid flow 
past a wing.  The wings on airplanes are really very simple things in comparison to the 
complex dynamics associated with the flight of living organisms such as birds and 
insects.  The key difference is that the wings of planes pretty much stay fixed in 
orientation while air blows over them, while for animals the wing is in usually in 
constant motion.  This is particularly true for insects:  it has often been said that a 
bumblebee really shouldn't be able to fly, yet somehow it manages anyway.  For a 
fascinating look at the world of insect flight, check out the research being done at
Berkeley described

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>A sphere and a jet: demonstration of Magnus Lift and the Coanda Effect.  
<p>Both Magnus Lift (which is where backspin or topspin causes deflection of a tennis ball) and the Coanda Effect (where a stream of water is deflected by the back side of a spoon) are the result of boundary layer deflection by interaction with a boundary.  By conservation of momentum, if a jet or wake is deflected in one direction, then there is a lateral force on the object producing the deflection in the other.  Here we demonstrate both effects using the jet provided by a vacuum cleaner and a large styrofoam ball.  While you are probably most familiar with these effects in sports, they play an important role in aerodynamics.  A really weird example is the use of Magnus lift to provide propulsion for freighters.  These "rotor ships" are described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotor_ship&oldid=1220385980">here</a>.  Basically, a giant rotor (called a Flettner rotor) can turn a cross wind into forward thrust, improving fuel efficiency.
