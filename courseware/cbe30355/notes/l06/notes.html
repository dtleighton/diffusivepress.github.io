<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Hero's Fountain:</ul>
<ul>In class today we demonstrated "Hero's Fountain", an example of hydrostatics
which goes back to Hero of Alexandria over two millenia ago - fluids research has been
going on a long time!  To learn more about this early fluid mechanic read the 
translation of his work from Greek given
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=O8PVAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover"> here</a>.  The Editor's
and Translator's Prefaces are also interesting.  The version of Hero's Fountain demonstrated
in class is given in Section 23, where the outlet of the "wine" is used as the inlet to the "water"
container.  Note that the relative height of the two vessels doesn't matter, which is what 
produces the interesting effect!</ul>
