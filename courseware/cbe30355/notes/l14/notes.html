The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Dimensional Analysis
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Use dimensional analysis to determine the number of dimensionless groups involved in a problem.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 3
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>In class we talked about the example of estimating the yield of a point explosion 
through dimensional analysis, solved for early atom bomb tests by G.I. Taylor.  A nice 
discussion of his result is provided 
<a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/311/notes/dimension/node7.html">here</a> and 
the complete paper (publication of which caused a bit of a stir, as the yield was still classified at
the time) can be found <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1950.0050">here</a>. 
It's a good illustration of the power of dimensional analysis to solve complicated problems.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>In class today we looked at the breakup of a drop in a viscous fluid in creeping flow in the absence of surface tension.  Theory suggests that while a spherical drop should be neutrally stable at zero Re, any imperfections are swept around to the back and cause it to transition into a toroidal shape.  Inertia then causes it to grow in radius, and this larger torus becomes unstable, resulting in two drops forming from the ring.  These drops are unstable in turn, leading to a cascade of ever smaller drops.  The theory behind this process is described in the paper by Kojima and Acrivos given <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.864511">here</a>.
<p>It actually turns out to be a little tricky to determine the best fluid combinations for a nice demonstration of the effect.  When the first demo failed (breakup occurred about the time the drop hit the bottom of the cylinder) I first turned to dimensional analysis to get an idea of the important relationships and then re-analyzed the data of Kojima (and later measurements by Pignatel et al., for clouds of particles) to determine a combination that actually would work.  The dimensional analysis is given <a href="miscible drop breakup dimensional analysis.pdf">here</a> and a more detailed analysis, together with some experiments used in optimizing the demonstration, is given <a href="Prediction of Breakup Heights.pdf">here</a>.
