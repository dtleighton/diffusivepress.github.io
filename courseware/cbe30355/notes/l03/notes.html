<!--<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>One of the fluid properties we talked about last Thursday was the coefficient of
thermal expansion.  To see an extreme example of what can happen if this property
is ignored, check out the link given

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
In class today we demonstrated bubbles - or actually anti-bubbles!  An ordinary soap bubble is a thin film of soapy water surrounding a sphere of air, and floating around in the air.  An anti-bubble is the exact reverse: a thin film of air surrounding a sphere of water and floating around in water.  In order to make the anti-bubble last a bit longer we add a little bit of sugar to increase the density of the water inside the air sheath (so that it counterbalances the lower density of the thin air sheath) and thus is neutrally buoyant.  From the density of this sugar solution (about 1.2 wt%) and anti-bubble size (2.9mm radius, 0.1ml volume), the thickness of the air sheath is only about 4Âµm! 
<br><br>
A nice article describing how to make anti-bubbles by Kim and Stone is found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Dynamics%20of%20the%20formation%20of%20antibubbles&publication_year=2008&author=P.G.%20Kim&author=H.A.%20Stone">here</a>.
<br><br>
A short movie of the anti-bubble is given <a href="https://notredame.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c9143ef9-efa8-401e-a8ba-b1df01741485">here</a>.
