<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>There are many examples of plumbing disasters on the web.  One which was particularly close to home was what happened during the Georgia Tech game in 1997 just after the stadium was expanded (not the skyboxes, just the upper bowl engulfment).  It was a nice example of what happens when you have pressure operated valves (which stick open when the pressure gets too -low-) and everyone flushes at half-time...  A description of the event can be found in the Notre Dame history <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=tPDqDwAAQBAJ">here</a>. (a screenshot of the relevant paragraph is given <a href="stadium overflow.pdf">here</a>)
