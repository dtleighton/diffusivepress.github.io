Read up to p233 of the notes and view the online narrations below.  The narration is divided into three pieces.  The first is the solution to flow past a sphere via index notation (the pages with no page numbers between 217 and 218), the second is the same problem but done using streamfunctions and some hand-waving (pages 218-226), and the third is showing how you can use the velocity an pressure distributions to calculate the drag on a sphere, as well as finishing off creeping flows with some useful integral theorems (pages 227-233).  Don't forget to complete the quiz in Canvas!

The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>The Streamfunction: Flow Past a Sphere
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Solve axisymmetric problems using the axisymmetric streamfunction.
<li>And do it the more sophisticated way using index notation...
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 4
</ul>

<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>Fluid mechanics is important in a wide range of biological systems.  At the cellular 
level the Reynolds number is usually quite low, and viscous forces are dominant.  At 
the organism level the Reynolds number is usually high and inertial forces are 
important.  Occasionally flows are so fast that cavitation 
effects are important!  A really cute example of such a flow is the phenomenon of the 
snapping shrimp, described
<a href="http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/shrimp/shrimpoluminescence.htm">here</a>.  A Science
article describing the details of the phenomenon is given
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/289/5487/2114.abstract">here</a>.

</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Stokes Flow Reversibility
<p>Our demonstration today is essentially identical to the classic G. I. Taylor demonstration of Stokes flow reversibility at low Reynolds numbers that can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/rA6T83FKuE8?si=EG7JUj0JtxjT2YoQ">here</a>.  The key is that if inertial and non-hydrodynamic effects (e.g., surface contact, surface tension, etc.) are absent, then reversal in time is the same as reversal in direction: you really can wind the clock backwards!  There's always a little loss of memory, of course, which has important implications for suspensions of particles at low Reynolds numbers.  A very nice discussion of such memory effects can be found at David Pine's <a href="https://physics.nyu.edu/pine/hydrodynamic_reversibility.html">website</a>.
