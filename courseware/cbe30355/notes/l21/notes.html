The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Boundary Layer Flows
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Scale the transport equations to determine the length scale appropriate in a boundary layer, and develop the Prandtl boundary layer equations.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 4
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>Boundary layer flows lead to fascinating phenomena.  One key problem in flow 
past a bluff body at high Re is boundary layer separation, and the transient wakes 
which form behind the body.  These vortices often become detatched from the object 
leading to what is called a von Karman Vortex Street.  As the eddies are shed from 
alternate sides of the body, there are often large lateral forces exerted on the body.  
To see a little movie of the vortex shedding process, go 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDeGDFZSYo8">here</a>.  These lateral
forces due to vortex shedding can interact with resonant frequencies of a structure leading to an effect called aeroelastic flutter.  Probably -the- classic example of this is the Tacoma Narrows bridge disaster.  A nice
collection of movies of the bridge is given
<a href="http://www.ketchum.org/bridgecollapse.html"> here</a>.  The aeroelastic instability isn't all bad, though - a company in Spain has developed into a new method for harvesting energy from
the wind that they claim is much cheaper than conventional windmills.  A description of the device may be found <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/vortex-bladeless-wind-turbine-generator/37563/">here</a>.

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>A Rainbow of Skittles.  The detailed discussion of the phenomenon is given <a href="skittles.pdf">here</a> and a nice movie of a dissolving Skittle (which we will demonstrate in class) is given <a href="https://notredame.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=85118b7b-0255-4437-93bf-b1d400f74eb4">here</a>.
