<h2>Cheg 355 Additional Readings Index</h2>
<ul>The following sites are ones which I found interesting, and which should expand
your understanding of the way transport phenomena fit into the larger world - 
sort of a "Fluid Mechanics Appreciation" seminar.  Anyway, take a look at them -
most of them are a whole lot of fun!</ul>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>The Gimli Glider</h3>
<ul>In class today we discussed fluid properties such as viscosity and density.  It's a
good idea to have a 'gut' knowledge of the magnitude of these quantities so you
have a better chance of knowing when your calculations are off - a sort of "Wait a 
minute, that doesn't make any sense" ability.  For a classic example of what can happen
if you - don't - I offer you the Gimli Glider, described <a href="http://www.wadenelson.com/gimli.html">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Acoustics in the Seas</h3>
<ul>In class we talked about the speed of sound.  While we won't be doing much
acoustics in this class, it's a fun topic.  While we usually think of sound propagating through air, in fact it is just as important how sound propagates through water - particularly if you are on a submarine!  For just about everything you ever wanted to know about sound in the sea, visit the website
<a href="http://www.dosits.org/">here</a>.  The history of underwater acoustics near the bottom of
<a href="https://dosits.org/people-and-sound/">this page</a> is particularly fascinating.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>The Boston Molasses Flood</h3>
<ul>One of the fluid properties we talked about last Thursday was the coefficient of
thermal expansion.  To see an extreme example of what can happen if this property
is ignored, check out the link given
<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/molasses-flood-physics-science/">here</a>.  We'll look at this case again
a little later, calculating the velocity profile in a homework problem.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Most of an iceberg is underwater - so what does it look like?</h3>
<ul>In class we talked about the fraction of an iceberg which was below the waterline.  Since the part above the waterline collects dirt, debris, and snow you get the usual "white" iceberg.  Every so often, one flips over.  To see what the underside looks like, go <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/photographer-captures-stunning-underside-flipped-iceberg-180953951/?no-ist">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>The Johnstown Flood</h3>
<ul>For homework you solved for the tremendous forces on a dam well below waterline.  A 
famous (and tragic) example of what can happen if these forces get a little too large is the 
Johnstown, West Virginia dam failure late in the 19th century.  For contemporary New York Times
articles on the disaster, click <a href="http://www.johnstownpa.com/History/hist30.html">here</a>.
A summary of the disaster can be found <a href="http://www.johnstownpa.com/History/hist19.html">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Cosmic Evolution</h3>
<ul>In class we've been dealing with conservation of mass and the continuity equation.
Perhaps the ultimate in matter conservation problems is the study of cosmology - the 
evolution of the universe we live in.  An interesting guide to the current theory of
cosmic evolution from the Big Bang to the present is given
<a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_01.htm"> here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Chaos Theory</h3>
<ul>In our class demonstration today we looked at how a thin drop of dye (water)
breaks up when dropped onto a concentrated surfactant (Triton X-100).  The water
drop was torn apart forming streamers and several generations of a fractal pattern.
Fractals are the result of non-linear dynamical systems, and are often found in fluid
mechanics.  For a website with lots of interesting videos of fractals, you can go
<a href="http://fractalfoundation.org/videos/">here</a>.  The fractal we saw in class
is similar to the fifth one down on the page.  The site also provides
an elementary course on fractals given <a href="http://fractalfoundation.org/resources/lessons/">
here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Pneumatics From a Looong Time Ago!</h3>
<ul>In class today we demonstrated "Hero's Fountain", an example of hydrostatics
which goes back to Hero of Alexandria over two millenia ago - fluids research has been
going on a long time!  To learn more about this early fluid mechanic read the 
translation of his work from Greek given
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=O8PVAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover"> here</a>.  
The Editor's and Translator's Prefaces are also interesting.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Crookes Radiometer</h3>
<ul>In our class demonstration today we looked at Crookes' Radiometer, which was
initially thought to be a demonstration of the momentum associated with quanta of
light.  It took many years before the noted hydrodynamicist Osborne Reynolds (1879) 
was able to show that it was actually a demonstration of the migration of molecules due 
to thermal gradients around the edges of the vanes.  For a detailed explanation of the 
phenomenon and its history, go <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/LightMill/light-mill.html">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Pyroclastic Flows</h3>
<ul>In class today we demonstrated the phenomenon of gravity driven flow down an 
inclined plane.  There are many examples of this, both in the laboratory and in nature.  
Perhaps the most spectacular, however, (and certainly the most deadly) are the 
pyroclastic flows associated with volcanic activity.  A good description of such flows 
may be found <a href="http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Pyroflows.html">here</a>.  </ul>

<hr>
<h3>Osborne Reynolds</h3>
<ul>The transition to turbulence for Poiseuille flow was first identified and described by
Osborne Reynolds, a famous fluid mechanic of the late 19th century.  He showed that
the transition occurred when the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces exceeded a
critical value, now named the Reynolds number in his honor.  The importance of this
parameter to fluid mechanics cannot be overstated, since as we shall see it controls
the flow pattern found in nearly every geometry.  A good biography of Reynolds
may be found <a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/jdjackson/Osborne%20Reynolds/oreyna.htm">here</a>.  
A description of how Reynolds determined this dimensionless group is given
<a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/jdjackson/Osborne%20Reynolds/oreynb.htm#OS421">here</a>.
</ul>


<hr>
<h3>G. I. Taylor</h3>
<ul>Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor is generally regarded as the preeminent fluid 
dynamicist of the 20th century.  His genius was to combine detailed mathematical 
treatment of complex phenomena with simple, precise experimental results.  In class we 
demonstrated one of the many phenomena associated with his name - the 
Taylor-Couette instability.  For a discussion of this and other phenomena associated 
with G. I. Taylor, go <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.883100">here</a>.  
The reference to Taylor-Couette flow is about half-way through the article (download the pdf file).  A brief 
biographical sketch of G.I. Taylor is given 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Taylor_Geoffrey.html">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Ship Modeling at the David Taylor Model Basin</h3>
<ul>A classic example of the use of dynamic similarity and the laws governing scale-up is the 
design of ships.  In the U.S. the main ship model design and testing center is the former 
David Taylor Model Basin (now the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare 
Center).  While you can't really keep the Reynolds number constant between model and the 
full scale ship, you can keep the Froude number constant.  This allows you to see how hull 
design, etc., affects bow waves, wakes, and drag.  Provided the Reynolds number is "high" for 
both model and full scale (so that viscous effects can be neglected), the drag on the model can 
be related to that on the full scale ship.  The history of the model basin may be found in an
ASME brochure given <a href="https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Who%20We%20Are/Engineering%20History/Landmarks/197-David-Taylor-Model-Basin-1939.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Dimensional Analysis and the Bomb</h3>
<ul>In class we talked about the example of estimating the yield of a point explosion 
through dimensional analysis, solved for early atom bomb tests by G.I. Taylor.  A nice 
discussion of his result is provided 
<a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/311/notes/dimension/node7.html">here</a> and 
the complete paper (publication of which caused a bit of a stir, as the yield was still classified at
the time) can be found <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1950.0050">here</a>.  It's a good 
illustration of the power of dimensional analysis to solve complicated problems.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Lab-on-a-Chip</h3>
<ul>Lubrication flows are just one example of flows at low Reynolds numbers where 
inertia may be neglected.  One active area of research in low Re system is the field of 
microfluidics, in which chemical laboratories are reduced to a microscale and reactants 
are pumped around through microchannels etched on a chip.  Wikipedia does a decent
job of describing some of the uses of this technology.  That article can
be found  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab-on-a-chip">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Ice Skating - Why You Slide</h3>
<ul>One of the most interesting examples of lubrication flows is that found in ice-
skating.  In that winter sport, the friction between the blade and the ice melts a small 
quantity of water, forming a thin lubricating layer.  The old story that it's the pressure 
of the blade which melts the ice isn't true - and the later theory that it's the frictional heating that does the trick isn't quite right either. Instead, the current theory is that there is a very thin layer of water at the surface of ice even well below freezing due to thermodynamic effects. 
A good discussion of the effects of a thin layer of water on ice (taken from a Physics Today article) is given <a href="http://lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/trizac/Ens/L3FIP/Ice.pdf">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Snowflakes</h3>
<ul>Winter is coming, and with it snow!  One subject which has always been of interest 
to me is the wonderful shapes of snowflakes.  If you've ever wondered why they grow 
as they do, you should explore the link given 
<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/primer/primer.htm">here</a> - an entire website devoted to the detailed understanding of ice crystals.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Snapping Shrimp</h3>
<ul>Fluid mechanics is important in a wide range of biological systems.  At the cellular 
level the Reynolds number is usually quite low, and viscous forces are dominant.  At 
the organism level the Reynolds number is usually high and inertial forces are 
important.  Occasionally flows are so fast that cavitation 
effects are important!  A really cute example of such a flow is the phenomenon of the 
snapping shrimp, described
<a href="http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/shrimp/shrimpoluminescence.htm">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>A Really Big Flow Meter</h3>
<ul>In class today we talked about Bernoulli's Equation and how it could be used to 
solve for pressure distributions - and how at high Re the pressure goes down when the 
velocity goes up!  A classic example of how this can be employed is the Venturi meter.  Basically, the flow rate of a 
fluid is measured by determining the pressure differential produced by a slight 
contraction of a pipe.  While usually little beasties (e.g., the diameter of a pipe), 
sometimes they can grow to truly gargantuan proportions.  A press release describing what is 
billed as the world's largest flow meter is given
<a href="http://www.pollutiononline.com/doc.mvc/Worlds-Largest-Venturi-Meter-Begins-Journey-0001">here</a>. 
You can also go directly to a picture of the thing <a href="https://www.snwa.com/assets/images/venturi-meter-16x9.jpg">here</a>.
The meter itself is a bit too big to put in the undergrad lab - in fact it
approaches the size of Fitzpatrick!</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Insect Flight</h3>
<ul>Today we talked about inviscid flow past a cylinder, and by analogy invicid flow 
past a wing.  The wings on airplanes are really very simple things in comparison to the 
complex dynamics associated with the flight of living organisms such as birds and 
insects.  The key difference is that the wings of planes pretty much stay fixed in 
orientation while air blows over them, while for animals the wing is in usually in 
constant motion.  This is particularly true for insects:  it has often been said that a 
bumblebee really shouldn't be able to fly, yet somehow it manages anyway.  For a 
fascinating look at the world of insect flight, check out the research being done at
Berkeley described
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/99legacy/6-15-1999.html">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Vortex Shedding</h3>
<ul>Boundary layer flows lead to fascinating phenomena.  One key problem in flow 
past a bluff body at high Re is boundary layer separation, and the transient wakes 
which form behind the body.  These vortices often become detatched from the object 
leading to what is called a von Karman Vortex Street.  As the eddies are shed from 
alternate sides of the body, there are often large lateral forces exerted on the body.  
To see a little movie of the vortex shedding process, go 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDeGDFZSYo8">here</a>.  These lateral
forces due to vortex shedding can interact with resonant frequencies of a structure leading to an effect called aeroelastic flutter.  Probably -the- classic example of this is the Tacoma Narrows bridge disaster.  A nice
collection of movies of the bridge is given
<a href="http://www.ketchum.org/bridgecollapse.html"> here</a>.  The aeroelastic instability isn't all bad, though - a company in Spain has developed into a new method for harvesting energy from
the wind that they claim is much cheaper than conventional windmills.  A description of the device may be found <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/vortex-bladeless-wind-turbine-generator/37563/">here</a>. </ul>

<hr>
<h3>Super Soakers</h3>
<ul>A fun application of Bernoulli's equation to summer fun is the Super Soaker!  
To see detailed information on how such squirt guns work, check out the link given 
<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/water-blaster.htm">here</a>.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Boundary Layer Control</h3>
<ul>For homework this week you are asked to solve for the velocity profile in 
boundary layer flow along a flat plate with suction - one of the techniques used to 
control boundary layer growth and separation.  A Physics Today article on the history of Prandtl's boundary layer theory and 
experiments is given 
<a href="http://www.aps.org/units/dfd/resources/upload/prandtl_vol58no12p42_48.pdf">here</a>.  A really lovely picture of the 
effect of suction on boundary layer separation over a wing may be found 
<a href="http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/courses/eml5935/00/topics/101601/node1.html">here</a>.  
Another link at the same site (given 
<a href="http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/courses/eml5935/00/topics/101601/node2.html">here</a>) 
has some interesting examples of experimental planes where the technique was used.</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Drag Reduction via Turbulence</h3>
<ul>In class we discussed the boundary layer separation which occurs as a result of the 
adverse pressure gradient on the back side of a sphere or other bluff body.  This 
separation may be delayed, and the drag reduced via pressure recovery, when the 
boundary layer becomes turbulent.  For a nice discussion of this transition, and 
associated drag reductions, check out the link given 
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~asmits/Bicycle_web/blunt.html">here</a>.
In addition to general information on drag reduction, this website also contains just
about everything you would want to know about the aerodynamics of bicycle design!
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Boundary Layer Separation and the Frisbee</h3>
<ul>An interesting example of boundary layer separation, turbulence, and angular 
momentum is the design of a frisbee.  Basically, the angular momentum produced by 
the spin of the frisbee (and the weighted edges) keeps the frisbee stable (constant 
orientation) while the aerodynamic lift produced by its motion relative to the air keeps 
it up.  Boundary layer control is important too:  The ridges around the edge of the 
frisbee promote turbulence and delay boundary layer separation, reducing drag.  The
first frisbees tended to be unstable and didn't fly terribly well.  It wasn't until the mid-60's
that the frisbee as we now know it was developed.  The patent on the ridges can be found 
<a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3359678?printsec=drawing#v=onepage&q&f=false">here</a>.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>How to Size a Pump</h3>
<ul>There are many sources of information on sizing pumps and designing piping networks
available on the web (although they do tend to disappear over time!).  A comprehensive one is
given <a href="http://www.pumpfundamentals.com/">here</a>.  
It would be a -really- good idea to review it if you are ever in charge of sizing a pump!  
Pump curves are also available on-line.  As as example, those for Sykes pumps (such as we
looked at in class today) are given <a href="http://www.allightsykes.com/products/pumps?brand=Himax%20High%20Head">here</a>.
Other links are 
available on the web for pipe fittings.  A useful one is given 
<a href="http://www.metropumps.com/ResourcesFrictionLossData.pdf">here</a>.  Examination of 
the data shows the K factors -do- change a little bit with diameter, but not very much!
