<!--In class we talked about the fraction of an iceberg which was below the waterline.  Since the part above the waterline collects dirt, debris, and snow you get the usual "white" iceberg.  Every so often, one flips over.  To see what the underside looks like, go <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/photographer-captures-stunning-underside-flipped-iceberg-180953951/?no-ist">here</a>.
-->
<p>I've written a couple of Matlab examples of how you can easily do linear regression on viscosity data (in the file <a href="ethglycolvisc.m">ethglycolvisc.m</a>) and integrate a system of ODE's (in the file <a href="rabbitsandfoxes.m">rabbitsandfoxes.m</a>).  You may find these examples useful for the homework next week...
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>In class today we demonstrated how hydraulics work, and how you can use a
column of water and a little math to make a weighing scale.  You should get to know
some key numbers:  1 atm = 33.9 ft of water = 10.3 meters of water, 1psig = 2.3 ft of 
water, etc.  These numbers are useful for doing back-of-the-envelope type calculations
in designing piping networks.  We'll look at such networks near the end of the term.
