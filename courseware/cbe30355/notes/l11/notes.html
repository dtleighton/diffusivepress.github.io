The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Poiseuille Flow and Couette Flow
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Solve flow problems in cylindrical coordinates.
<li>Identify the centrifugal and coriolis force terms in the momentum equations and know where they are important.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 3
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>The transition to turbulence for Poiseuille flow was first identified and described by
Osborne Reynolds, a famous fluid mechanic of the late 19th century.  He showed that
the transition occurred when the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces exceeded a
critical value, now named the Reynolds number in his honor.  The importance of this
parameter to fluid mechanics cannot be overstated, since as we shall see it controls
the flow pattern found in nearly every geometry.  A good biography of Reynolds
may be found <a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/jdjackson/Osborne%20Reynolds/oreyna.htm">here</a>.  
A description of how Reynolds determined this dimensionless group is given
<a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/jdjackson/Osborne%20Reynolds/oreynb.htm#OS421">here</a>.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Poiseuille's Law, or how you can measure the viscosity of a fluid with an ordinary funnel.  A description of the experiment is given <a href="funnel viscometer.pdf">here</a>.
