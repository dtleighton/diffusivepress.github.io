The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>High Re Flows:  Bernoulli's Equation
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Use Bernoulli's Equation to solve for the pressure distribution in different geometries.
<li>Know what inviscid, irrotational flow means!
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 4
</ul>
<hr>
<!--<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>In class today we talked about Bernoulli's Equation and how it could be used to 
solve for pressure distributions - and how at high Re the pressure goes down when the 
velocity goes up!  A classic example of how this can be employed is the Venturi meter.  
Basically, the flow rate of a 
fluid is measured by determining the pressure differential produced by a slight 
contraction of a pipe.  While usually little beasties (e.g., the diameter of a pipe), 
sometimes they can grow to truly gargantuan proportions.  A press release describing what is 
billed as the world's largest flow meter is given
<a href="http://www.pollutiononline.com/doc.mvc/Worlds-Largest-Venturi-Meter-Begins-Journey-0001">here</a>.
You can also go directly to a picture of the thing <a href="https://www.snwa.com/assets/images/venturi-meter-16x9.jpg">here</a>.
The meter itself is a bit too big to put in the undergrad lab - in fact it
approaches the size of Fitzpatrick!</ul>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>How blowing on a plate can actually lead to suction.  While the example in class is rather whimsical, the Bernoulli effect illustrated by it is of importance in many applications. As an example, Bernoulli suction forms the basis of contactless grippers which can be used to pick up fragile objects.  This is described in the Wikipedia article found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernoulli_grip&oldid=1180462961">here</a> and a fun movie of such a system is found <a href="https://www.vacuumdaily.net/2019/01/bernoulli-suction-cups-its-not-magic-its-a-project/">here</a>.
