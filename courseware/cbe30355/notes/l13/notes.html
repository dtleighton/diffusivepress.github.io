<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>A classic example of the use of dynamic similarity and the laws governing scale-up is the 
design of ships.  In the U.S. the main ship model design and testing center is the former 
David Taylor Model Basin (now the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare 
Center).  While you can't really keep the Reynolds number constant between model and the 
full scale ship, you can keep the Froude number constant.  This allows you to see how hull 
design, etc., affects bow waves, wakes, and drag.  Provided the Reynolds number is "high" for 
both model and full scale (so that viscous effects can be neglected), the drag on the model can 
be related to that on the full scale ship.  The history of the model basin may be found in an
ASME brochure given <a href="https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Who%20We%20Are/Engineering%20History/Landmarks/197-David-Taylor-Model-Basin-1939.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Extra Stuff for the Interested...</h2>
<ul>In the last class we talked about systems which were linearly unstable (e.g., Taylor-Couette vortices) and those which were unstable only to finite disturbances (laminar flow in a tube transitioning to turbulence).  Linear stability theory is a bit beyond this class (but the graduate course covers it), however I thought those of you who are interested might want to explore the simplest problem: the instability of an autocatalytic system (e.g., an atom bomb).  The writeup is given <a href="linear stability theory.pdf">here</a>, and a fun Monte Carlo simulation and movie is given in the file <a href="bombsim.m">bombsim.m</a> and in the livescript <a href="bombsimx.mlx">bombsimx.mlx</a>.  Have fun!

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Dynamic Similarity of Vortices
<p>Dimensional analysis plays a very important role in engineering!  For fluid mechanics problems such as a vortex flow where there is a free surface, the key dimensionless groups are the Reynolds number and the Froude number: keep those constant and the flow patterns should be (nearly) identical even when the size scale changes!  A nice historical review of the use of dimensional analysis over the ages is provided by Macagno, which may be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-0032(71)90160-8">here</a>.
