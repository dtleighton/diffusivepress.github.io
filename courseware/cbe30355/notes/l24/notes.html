<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Show how boundary layers grow in favorable or adverse pressure gradients.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 4
</ul>

<h3>Drag Reduction via Turbulence</h3>
<ul>In class we discussed the boundary layer separation which occurs as a result of the 
adverse pressure gradient on the back side of a sphere or other bluff body.  This 
separation may be delayed, and the drag reduced via pressure recovery, when the 
boundary layer becomes turbulent.  For a nice discussion of this transition, and 
associated drag reductions, check out the link given 
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~asmits/Bicycle_web/blunt.html">here</a>.
In addition to general information on drag reduction, this website also contains just
about everything you would want to know about the aerodynamics of bicycle design!
