The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Similarity
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Render the equations of motion dimensionless.
<li>Apply the law of dynamic similarity to develop scale models.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapter 3
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Matlab Example:</h2>
<ul>For homework you are asked to to a simple error calculation to determine the confidence interval of a calculated value.  An example of how this can be done via the standard formula and via MC simulation is given in the file <a href="mcerrordemo.m">mcerrordemo.m</a>.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>Taylor Vortices.
<p>Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor is generally regarded as the preeminent fluid 
dynamicist of the 20th century.  His genius was to combine detailed mathematical 
treatment of complex phenomena with simple, precise experimental results.  In class we 
demonstrated one of the many phenomena associated with his name - the 
Taylor-Couette instability.  For a discussion of this and other phenomena associated 
with G. I. Taylor, go <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.883100">here</a>.  
The reference to Taylor-Couette flow is about half-way through the article (download the pdf file).  A brief 
biographical sketch of G.I. Taylor is given 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Taylor_Geoffrey.html">here</a>.
