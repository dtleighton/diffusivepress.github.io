<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>An interesting example of boundary layer separation, turbulence, and angular 
momentum is the design of a frisbee.  Basically, the angular momentum produced by 
the spin of the frisbee (and the weighted edges) keeps the frisbee stable (constant 
orientation) while the aerodynamic lift produced by its motion relative to the air keeps 
it up.  Boundary layer control is important too:  The ridges around the edge of the 
frisbee promote turbulence and delay boundary layer separation, reducing drag.  The
first frisbees tended to be unstable and didn't fly terribly well.  It wasn't until the mid-60's
that the frisbee as we now know it was developed.  The patent on the ridges can be found
