The main points of the lecture were
<ul>
<li>Friction Factors
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
After this class you should be able to:
<ul><li>Calculate head loss in a piping network.
<li>Read a pump curve.
<li>Know what NPSHR is and how to avoid frying a pump.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class notes.
<li>BS&L, chapters 6&7
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Additional Readings:</h2>
<ul>There are many sources of information on sizing pumps and designing piping networks
available on the web (although they do tend to disappear over time!).  A comprehensive one is
given <a href="http://www.pumpfundamentals.com/">here</a>.  
It would be a -really- good idea to review it if you are ever in charge of sizing a pump!  
Pump curves are also available on-line.  As as example, that for the HH80 Sykes pump (such as we
looked at in class today) is given <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311002948/http://www.allightsykes.com/products/pumps/Himax%20High%20Head/HH80">here</a>.
Other links are 
available on the web for pipe fittings.  A useful one is given 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221007030837/https://www.metropumps.com/ResourcesFrictionLossData.pdf">here</a>.  Examination of 
the data shows the K factors -do- change a little bit with diameter, but not very much!  
<p>Note that because of changes to various corporate websites you now need to use the <a href="https://web.archive.org">"wayback machine"</a> to access these web pages - but the internet never really forgets...
