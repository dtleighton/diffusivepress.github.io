<h1>ASM Lecture of David T Leighton, Sr.</h1>
<p>The is the recording of an invited lecture given by David T Leighton, Sr (1/21/1925 - 1/6/2017) to the Golden Gate Chapter of the American Society of Materials in Oakland CA in January of 1961 on the status and development of the Nuclear Navy.  This important historical document provides a fascinating account of both the history and difficulties encountered in the development of nuclear power for the Navy, with particular emphasis on submarines.  It also illustrates the origins of the culture of Naval Reactors of the importance of attention to detail.  At the time, then Cdr. Leighton was the Naval Nuclear Power Superintendent of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard.  David Leighton served for many years as one of Admiral H. G. Rickover's top assistants in the development of the Nuclear Navy.  For his services, first as an active duty officer in the USN, and later as a civilian working for Naval Reactors, he was recognized by the top awards offered by the Department of the Navy, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense.</p>
