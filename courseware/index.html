  <h3>Educational Materials and Full Course Content</h3>

  <p>
    This section will host a collection of instructional content developed over many years at the University of Notre Dame. It will include syllabi, lecture notes, problem sets, and more‚Äîavailable to students, educators, and independent learners.

<h4><a href="transportmath">Transport Math</a></h4>
  <p>Transport is an intrinsically mathematical subject, and unfortunately math skills fade very quickly once the semester is over.  To help students "pick it back up"
  again I've constructed a set of short "reminder" lectures covering the key techniques used in a transport course.  This material is useful for undergraduates,
  but also for first year grad students prior to their first grad transport or math class.  Students have commented that the review was a "real life-saver".
  These notes are given <a href="transportmath">here</a>.</p>

  <h4><a href="asmlecture">ASM Lecture on the Status of the Nuclear Navy</a></h4>
  <p>In 1961 David Leighton was invited to give a lecture to the Golden Gate Chapter of the American Society of Materials on the status of the Nuclear Navy.
  This lecture was recorded and preserved for posterity, providing a remarkable snapshot of the development of the Nuclear Navy and what went into the many
  critical engineering choices that were made.  The audio file has been transcribed by the Naval Historical Foundation.</p>
